Realize that this is meant to be a practice a assignment for you to use to practice a bit with the `Stack ADT` and `Linked Lists` and python (in case its been a minute for you). If you straight-up copy stuff, you're really only hurting yourself, but _you do you_ ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯.\n",

The point here is practice and learning. A little stress in thinking doesn't hurt (it _can_ be helpful!) and **I don't consent or agree to allowing the content for this course to be input into a generative AI system**. In the end, you are getting in the way of your own learning **and** giving unauthorized access of content in this course to companies that, ultimately, would be perfectly fine if all human activity is automated (no matter the quality), as long as the bottom-line is good. Think critically and understand that your practices now may affect your labor in the future. We can't control how other entities use generative AI systems, but we can encourage critical engagement with such systems in this class! **Don't worry, we'll discuss and understand these systems later in the course so that you can critically engage with them and have a nuanced understanding if/when you want to use such systems**\n",
